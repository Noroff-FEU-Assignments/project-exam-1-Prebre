# Wizards of the Web

![image](images/wotw-index-500.png)

The purpose of this project is to showcase what I have learned about design, layout, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and API calls.

## Description

Wizards of the Web is a project where the base purpose is to create a blog site by fetching information from an API and print it to a web site as HTML. I chose to have the blog focus on the table top roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons, dedicating the theme to provide posts includinng ideas and inspiration for characters, stories and combinations that might seem interesting for the reader.

The project description specified to include the following pages:

- Home, displaying a slider/carousel previewing some of the newest posts on the blog.
- Blog post list page, displaying the last 10 posts and allowing the user to load the next 10 (or the rest, if less than 10 is available) posts.
- Blog post details page, displaying the most important content of each blog post as the user chooses from the home page or blog post list.
- About page.
- Contact page containing a form that's validated before it's submitted.

## Built With

I built this website using the following coding languages and APIs:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [WordPress REST API](https://ikpb-mar21pt-cms-ma1.com/wp-json/wp/v2)

2. Install the dependencies:

To run the app, run the following commands:

## Contributing

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.
